# Football Team Valuation Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of football team valuations using a dataset that includes various features influencing the financial valuation of football teams across major European leagues.

## Dataset Overview

The "Predicting Football Team Valuations" dataset contains detailed information about 50,000 football teams from major European leagues. This dataset includes both numeric and categorical features that are instrumental in determining the financial valuation of these teams.

The dataset can be found in Kaggle: [Football Teams Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashadrmammadov/football-teams-price-prediction/data)

### Features

1. **Numeric Columns**:
   - `AveragePlayerAge`: The average age of players in the team.
   - `TotalGoalsLastSeason`: Total goals scored by the team in the last season.
   - `MatchesWonLastSeason`: Number of matches won in the last season.
   - `MatchesDrawnLastSeason`: Number of matches drawn in the last season.
   - `MatchesLostLastSeason`: Number of matches lost in the last season.
   - `TotalGoalsConcededLastSeason`: Total goals conceded by the team in the last season.
   - `TotalRevenueLastSeason`: Total revenue generated by the team in the last season.
   - `StadiumCapacity`: Capacity of the team's stadium.
   - `AverageAttendance`: Average attendance at home matches.
   - `TransferSpendingLastSeason`: Amount spent on player transfers in the last season.
   - Additional numeric features may be present.

2. **Categorical Columns**:
   - `Country`: Country where the team is based.
   - `Manager`: Name of the team's manager.
   - `TeamFormation`: Formation typically used by the team (e.g., 4-2-3-1, 3-4-3).
   - `PlayingStyle`: Style of play (e.g., Counter-Attack, Defensive, Attacking).
   - `HomeCity`: City where the team is based.
   - `StadiumType`: Type of stadium (e.g., Multipurpose, Classic, Historical).
   - `MainSponsor`: Primary sponsor of the team.
   - `KitManufacturer`: Company manufacturing the team's kit.
   - `OwnershipType`: Type of ownership (e.g., Private, Consortium).
   - Additional categorical features may be present.

3. **Target Column**:
   - `Price`: The market price of the team in billions of dollars.

## Analysis and Modeling

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Conversion of the `Price` column to numeric values.
   - Handling missing values and ensuring proper data types for each column.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Distribution analysis of team valuations.
   - Relationship analysis between various features and team valuations.
   - Correlation analysis to identify important features.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creation of new features such as `GoalsPerMatch` and `RevenuePerAttendance`.

4. **Advanced Modeling**:
   - Building a RandomForestRegressor model to predict team valuations.
   - Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
   - Evaluation of model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

5. **Feature Importance**:
   - Identification of the most important features influencing team valuations using feature importance scores from the RandomForestRegressor.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the factors influencing football team valuations. Key findings include:
- Higher revenue, larger stadium capacity, and higher attendance are associated with higher team valuations.
- Features related to revenue, attendance, and stadium capacity are among the most important predictors of team valuation.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the factors influencing football team valuations. By leveraging advanced EDA, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, we can better understand the underlying drivers of team value and build more accurate predictive models. These insights can be valuable for stakeholders in the football industry, including team owners, investors, and analysts.
